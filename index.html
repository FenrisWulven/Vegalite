          <h2>Why is inflation important?</h2>
          <p>
            Inflation is a measure of the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services is rising and thus the purchasing power is falling.
            As a result of inflation, currency from 50 years ago is worth less now, than it was back then. Inflation is important because it affects the value
            of money, and thus the cost of living. It is therefore often viewed as a measure of the health of the economy. In general, an inflation of 2-3% is considered desirable, as it
            is low enough to not cause a recession, but high enough to encourage economic growth. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Inflation is measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which is a measure of the average change over time in the prices of goods and services. 
            The total CPI used for this visualisation includes food and energy, even though they are often regarded as quite volatile. This is to ensure a wholistic view on worldwide inflation rates.
            As seen on the choropleth map of figure 1, countries such as Russia or Turkey currently have very high inflation rates, while countries such as Germany or the United States have lower and more controlled inflation rates.
            This can often be explained by the political stability and economic health of a country. Evident on the line chart of figure 1 is an increase of the global average inflation rate, which could be cause by events such as COVID-19 and the Russo-Ukrainian war.

          <h3>Which countries have the highest and lowest inflation?</h3>
          <p>A very high inflation rate of over 10% can affect how peoples daily habits, as their money is worth less. This can reduce economic growth. 
            Conversely, a very low inflation rate can also be problematic, as it can lead to deflation, which is a decrease in the general level of prices. 
            This can be the cause of a recesseion, where people are less likely to spend money, as they are afraid of losing more money in the future.
            As seen on the bar chart of figure 2, in 2012 the countries with the highest inflation rates are India and Turkey. 
            Interestingly, in 2012 Switzerland and Japan had negative inflation rates, also called deflation. One problem caused by this is that the real value of debt increases.</p>
